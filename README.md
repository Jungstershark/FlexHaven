Welcome to the official repository for **Flexhaven**, an Android app created as part of the SUTD 50.002 Introduction to Information Systems, supported by Singtel Singapore. This app serves as a proof of concept for a rental platform specifically designed for students and young working professionals who may find buying new expensive items like suits, iPads, or other equipment unfeasible due to budget constraints. Flexhaven provides a prototype platform for the renting of such items, aiming to offer a sustainable and economical solution.

 **Note**: *This app is still a prototype and does not integrate actual payment systems.*

## Problem Statement

Many students and young professionals are on limited budgets and cannot afford to buy new, expensive clothing or equipment. Our app aims to address this issue by providing a platform for renting these items at a more affordable price.

## Features

- **Browse and Rent**: Users can browse a variety of items and choose to rent them.
- **User Profiles**: Manage your rental transactions through a user-friendly profile.
- **Item Listings**: Users can list items they own for rent.
- **Search**: Search items by categories to find the item to rent

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: Primary programming language for Android development.
- **XML**: Used for designing the user interfaces.
- **Firebase Real-time Database API**: Manages database operations.
- **Firebase Cloud Storage API**: Handles the storage and retrieval of images, with links saved in the real-time database.
